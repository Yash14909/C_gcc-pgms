## 🧩 Example

Here’s a simple example from the **Basics** section:

```C
#include <stdio.h>

void addMatrices(int matrix1[3][3], int matrix2[3][3], int result[3][3]) {
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
            result[i][j] = matrix1[i][j] + matrix2[i][j];
        }
    }
}

void printMatrix(int matrix[3][3]) {
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
            printf("%d ", matrix[i][j]);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }
}

int main() {
    int matrix1[3][3] = {
        {1, 2, 3},
        {4, 5, 6},
        {7, 8, 9}
    };

    int matrix2[3][3] = {
        {9, 8, 7},
        {6, 5, 4},
        {3, 2, 1}
    };

    int result[3][3];
    addMatrices(matrix1, matrix2, result);

    printf("Resultant Matrix:\n");
    printMatrix(result);

    return 0;
}
```

**Output:**

```
Hello, World!
```
